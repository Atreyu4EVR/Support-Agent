## Mission & Affiliation

Brigham Young University–Idaho “was founded and is supported and guided by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Its mission is to develop disciples of Jesus Christ who are leaders in their homes, the Church, and their communities.” Because of that affiliation, all students agree to live the Church Educational System Honor Code, and institutional priorities are set by Church leaders.

- Learning Model: Every course is built around Prepare → Teach One Another → Ponder & Prove, shifting class time from lecture to active learning.
- Large-Scale Online Partnership: Through BYU-Pathway Worldwide, BYU-Idaho delivers low-cost online degrees and certificates to tens of thousands of students globally.
- Low Tuition & “Spirit of Ricks” Culture: As a Church-subsidized school with no graduate programs, BYU-Idaho keeps tuition among the lowest in the United States and cultivates a close-knit, service-oriented campus ethos.
